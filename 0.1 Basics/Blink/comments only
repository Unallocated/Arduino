  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

// Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
// give it a name:


// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
              
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.



// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:

                     // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
                    // wait for a second
                   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
                  // wait for a second
