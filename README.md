Repo for Unallocated Space's Friday Night Arduino class


This class will be for beginers, intermediates, and projects.

The idea is to start with the beginer class.

Then do the intermediate class.

Then finally do the projects.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE BEGINER CLASS

The idea is to borrow heavily from the stock code provided with the IDE.

We will provide a heavily commented document to start.  This will have guides and notes

The students will have the code available in their IDE if the are stuck and need aditional assistance beyond the
instruction provided.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERMEDIATE SESSION

New Ideas and cool things will be displayed, given instruction, and help the student accomplish it.

We will take a not so easy and simple approach to ideas and lessons.  

The classes will/may be out of the grasp of the beginer class but jump in and learn its fun.




---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROJECT TIME/ADVANCED SESSION

Here we will help each other or work on projects or try super hard things with wreckless hope and wonder.

Are you stuck on a project need help or a second set of eyes to check something out?

We want to go way out there and fail and win and fail again.
