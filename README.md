Repo for Unallocated Space's Friday Night Arduino class


This class will be for beginers, intermediates, and projects.

The idea is to start with the beginer class.

Then do the intermediate class.

Then finally do the projects.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE BEGINER CLASS

The idea is to borrow heavily from the stock code provided with the IDE.

We will provide a heavily commented document to start.  This will have guides and notes

The students will have the code available in their IDE if the are stuck and need aditional assistance beyond the
instruction provided.
